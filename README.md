> pSuc-FFSEA: Predicting lysine succinylation sites in proteins based on feature fusion and stacking ensemble algorithm

üêπ A new method for Identifying lysine succinylation.

For the convenience of the most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for pSuc-FFSEA has been established at http://bioinfo.wugenqiang.top/pSuc-FFSEA/ as a major site and https://bio.cangmang.xyz as a backup, by which users can easily obtain the results they want without going through the detailed mathematics.
